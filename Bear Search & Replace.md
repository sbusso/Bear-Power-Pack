# Bear Search & Replace

Text replace, RegEx, and text factories on Bear notes on iOS.

**Install workflow: [Bear Search & Replace](https://workflow.is/workflows/3c8ed87a3a584ae5bd89db36a6566dfe)**

*See also: [Bear Power Pack](https://github.com/rovest/Bear-Power-Pack/blob/master/README.md)*

### Features
- Input text from Bear TXT file export  
	(TXT export is roundtrip safe, while md loses image links!)
- Opens result in a new Bear note
- If no input, uses clipboard and sends result to clipboard only. (Chose Copy as Markdown to keep tags and links, but not images!)
- Choice of plain text replace, case sensitive, or RegEx
- Predefined text factories
